A QR code (Quick Response Code) is a type of matrix code (2-Dimensional Bar code) invented in 1994 by an automobile company, Denso Wave. A QR code is a machine readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached to. It was primarily developed to locate, identify and track the automotive parts. However, due to its fast readability it has become popular across different industries.
